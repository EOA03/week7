# Assignment Weekly 7

## INTRODUCTION

This week (week 7), the assignment is to make a website about Financial tracking to input assets and get the list.

## TOOLS

I made this website using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and the Node.js ecosystem. For the CSS, I used Bootstrap to make it easy. After making the website, I deployed it using Netlify.

## DESCRIPTION

Key features of the Financial Tracker:
1. Expense and Income: Easily list and categorize your expenses and income.
2. Name and Amount Entry: The tracker allows you to input the name of the expense or income. You can also specify the amount associated with the entry.
3. Date Input: Keep track of when each expense or income occurred by adding the date for every entry.
4. Detailed Description: You can add additional details or notes to each entry.
5. Bottom List Display: All your recorded expenses and income are displayed at the bottom of the page.
